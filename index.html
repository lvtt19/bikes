                           The history of the motorcycle begins in the second half of the 19th century. Motorcycles are
                           descended from the "safety
                           bicycle," a bicycle with front and rear wheels of the same size and a pedal crank mechanism
                           to
                           drive the rear wheel.
                           Despite some early landmarks in its development, the motorcycle lacks a rigid pedigree that
                           can
                           be
                           traced back to a
                           single idea or machine. Instead, the idea seems to have occurred to numerous engineers and
                           inventors around Europe at
                           around the same time.

                           In the 1860s Pierre Michaux, a blacksmith in Paris, founded 'Michaux et Cie' ("Michaux and
                           company"), the first company
                           to construct bicycles with pedals called a velocipede at the time, or "Michauline". The first
                           steam
                           powered motorcycle,
                           the Michaux-Perreaux steam velocipede, can be traced to 1867, when Pierre's son Ernest
                           Michaux
                           fitted a small steam
                           engine to one of the 'velocipedes'.
                           <br>
                           In 1881, Lucius Copeland of Phoenix, Arizona designed a much smaller steam boiler which could
                           drive
                           the large rear wheel
                           of an American Star high-wheeler at 12 mph. In 1887 Copeland formed the Northrop
                           Manufacturing
                           Co.
                           to produce the first
                           successful 'Moto-Cycle' (actually a three-wheeler).

                           In 1901 English quadricycle- and bicycle-maker Royal Enfield introduced its first motorcycle,
                           with
                           a 239 cc engine
                           mounted in the front and driving the rear wheel through a belt. In 1898 English bicycle-maker
                           Triumph decided to extend
                           its focus to include motorcycles, and by 1902 the company had produced its first motorcycle—a
                           bicycle fitted with a
                           Belgian-built engine. A year later it was the largest motorcycle-manufacturer, with an annual
                           production of over 500
                           units. Other British firms included Norton and Birmingham Small Arms Company who began
                           motorbike
                           production in 1902 and
                           1910, respectively.

                           By 1920, Harley-Davidson became the largest manufacturer, with their motorcycles being sold
                           by
                           dealers in 67 countries.

                           After the World War II, some American veterans found a replacement for the camaraderie,
                           excitement,
                           danger and speed of
                           life at war in motorcycles. Grouped into loosely organized clubs, motorcycle riders in the
                           US
                           created a new social
                           institution—the motorcyclists or "bikers"—which was later skewed by the "outlaw" persona
                           Marlon
                           Brando portrayed in the
                           1953 film The Wild One.

                           In Europe, on the other hand, post-war motorcycle producers were more concerned with
                           designing
                           practical, economical
                           transportation than the social aspects, or "biker" image. Italian designer Piaggio
                           introduced
                           the
                           Vespa in 1946, which
                           experienced immediate and widespread popularity. Imports from the UK, Italy and
                           Germany, thus
                           found
                           a niche in US
                           markets that American bikes did not fill.

                           The motorcycle also became a recreational machine for sport and leisure, a vehicle
                           for
                           carefree
                           youth, not essential
                           transportation for the mature family man or woman, and the Japanese were able to
                           produce
                           modern
                           designs more quickly,
                           more cheaply, and of better quality than their competitors. Their motorbikes were
                           more
                           stylish
                           and
                           more reliable, so the
                           British manufacturers fell behind as mass-market producers.

                           Honda introduced their SOHC
                           inline-four engine CB750 in
                           1969, which was inexpensive and immediately successful. It established the

                              BMW's motorcycle history began in 1921 when the company commenced manufacturing engines
                              for other companies. BMW's own motorcycles—sold under the BMW Motorrad brand—began in 1923
                              with the BMW R 32, which was powered by a flat-twin engine. Production of motorcycles with
                              flat-twin engines continues to this day, however BMW has also produced many models with
                              other types of engines. At the end of World War I, the Treaty of Versailles demanded that
                              BMW cease production of aircraft engines. BMW merged with Bayerische Flugzeugwerke in
                              1922, and the BFw Helios became the starting point for the first BMW motorcycle. Released
                              in 1923, the BMW R 32 used a 486 cc flat-twin petrol engine. During World War II, the
                              German military needed as many vehicles as it could get of all types and many other German
                              companies were asked to build motorcycles. The R 75 inspired similar models from U.S.
                              manufacturers, such as the Indian 841 and Harley-Davidson XA. Production of flat-twin
                              models resumed in 1950 with the 500 cc R 51/2 model, which was followed by the BMW R 51/3
                              and BMW R 67 twins in 1951, and the sporting 26 kW (35 hp) BMW R 68 in 1952. Except for
                              the R 68, all flat-twin models came with "bell-bottom" front fenders and front stands.
                              Changes in the motorcycle market saw BMW's last shaft-driven single-cylinder model, the
                              BMW R 27, end production in 1967. The model range was entirely revamped in 1969 with the
                              introduction of the BMW/5. The BMW/6 range replaced the "/5" models in 1974, with the 500
                              cc engine being discontinued and a 900 cc engine introduced. In 1976, the BMW /7 range
                              replaced the "/6" models.

                              Honda is the largest motorcycle manufacturer in Japan and has been since it started
                              production in 1955. During the 1960s, when it was a small manufacturer, Honda broke out of
                              the Japanese motorcycle market and began exporting to the U.S. The campaign was hugely
                              successful. The ads ran for three years, and by the end of 1963 alone, Honda had sold
                              90,000 motorcycles. Soichiro Honda, being a race driver himself, could not stay out of
                              international motorsport. In 1959, Honda entered five motorcycles into the Isle of Man TT
                              race, the most prestigious motorcycle race in the world. While always having powerful
                              engines, it took until 1961 for Honda to tune their chassis well enough to allow Mike
                              Hailwood to claim their first Grand Prix victories in the 125 and 250 cc classes. Hailwood
                              would later pick up their first Senior TT wins in 1966 and 1967. Honda's race bikes were
                              known for their "sleek & stylish design" and exotic engine configurations, such as the
                              5-cylinder, 22,000 rpm, 125 cc bike and their 6-cylinder 250 cc and 297 cc bikes.

                              In 1926 Antonio Cavalieri Ducati and his three sons, Adriano, Marcello, and Bruno, founded
                              Società Scientifica Radio Brevetti Ducati in Bologna to produce vacuum tubes, condensers
                              and other radio components. Barely a month after the official liberation of Italy in 1944,
                              SIATA announced its intention to sell this engine, called the "Cucciolo" to the public.
                              The first Cucciolos were available alone, to be mounted on standard bicycles, by the
                              buyer; however, businessmen soon bought the little engines in quantity, and offered
                              complete motorized-bicycle units for sale. In 1953, management split the company into two
                              separate entities, Ducati Meccanica SpA and Ducati Elettronica, in acknowledgment of its
                              diverging motorcycle and electronics product lines. Dr. Giuseppe Montano took over as head
                              of Ducati Meccanica SpA and the Borgo Panigale factory was modernized with government
                              assistance. By 1954, Ducati Meccanica SpA had increased production to 120 bikes a day. In
                              the 1960s, Ducati earned its place in motorcycling history by producing the fastest 250 cc
                              road bike then available, the Mach 1. In the 1970s Ducati began producing motorcycles with
                              large-displacement V-twin engines, which Ducati branded as "L-twin" for their 90° angle,
                              and in 1973, introduced their trademarked desmodromic valve design. In 1985, Cagiva bought
                              Ducati and planned to rebadge Ducati motorcycles with the "Cagiva" name. By the time the
                              purchase was completed, Cagiva kept the "Ducati" name on its motorcycles.

                              Triumph Engineering Co Ltd was a British motorcycle manufacturing company, based
                              originally in Coventry and then in Meriden. A new company, Triumph Motorcycles Ltd, based
                              in Hinckley, gained the name rights after the end of the company in the 1980s and is now
                              one of the world's major motorcycle manufacturers. The company was started by Siegfried
                              Bettmann, who had emigrated from Nuremberg, part of the German Empire, to Coventry in
                              England in 1883. In 1898 Triumph decided to extend production at Coventry to include
                              motorcycles, and by 1902 the company had produced its first motorcycle — a bicycle fitted
                              with a Belgian Minerva engine. The beginning of the First World War was a boost for the
                              company as production was switched to provide for the Allied war effort. More than 30,000
                              motorcycles—among them the Model H Roadster also known as the "Trusty Triumph", often
                              cited as the first modern motorcycle were supplied to the Allies. In 1936, the company's
                              two components became separate companies. 500 cc 5T Triumph Speed Twin released in
                              September 1937, and the basis for all Triumph twins until the 1980s. At the 1948 Motor
                              Cycle Show was introduced a 498cc TR5 Trophy Twin. In 1959, the T120, a tuned double
                              carburettor version of the Triumph Tiger T110, came to be known as the Bonneville. In 1969
                              Malcolm Uphill, riding a Bonneville, won the Isle of Man Production TT race with a race
                              average of 99.99 miles per hour (160.92 km/h) per lap, and recorded the first ever more
                              than 100 miles per hour (161 km/h) lap by a production motorcycle at 100.37 miles per hour
                              (161.53 km/h). For many Triumph fans, the 1969 Bonneville was the best Triumph model ever.

                              Harley-Davidson, Inc., H-D, or Harley, is an American motorcycle manufacturer founded in
                              1903 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Harley-Davidson is noted for a style of customization that
                              gave rise to the chopper motorcycle style. Production in 1905 and 1906 were all
                              single-cylinder models with 26.84-cubic-inch (440 cc) engines. In February 1907, they
                              displayed a prototype model at the Chicago Automobile Show with a 45-degree V-Twin engine.
                              These first V-Twins displaced 53.68 cubic inches (880 cc) and produced about 7 horsepower
                              (5.2 kW). This gave about double the power of the first singles, and top speed was about
                              60 mph (100 km/h). By 1920, Harley-Davidson was the largest motorcycle manufacturer in the
                              world, with 28,189 machines produced and dealers in 67 countries. One of only two American
                              cycle manufacturers to survive the Great Depression,[37][38] Harley-Davidson again
                              produced large numbers of motorcycles for the US Army in World War II and resumed civilian
                              production afterwards, producing a range of large V-twin motorcycles that were successful
                              both on racetracks and for private buyers. Harley-Davidson, on the eve of World War II,
                              was already supplying the Army with a military-specific version of its 45 cubic inches
                              (740 cm3) WL line, called the WLA. Shipments to the Soviet Union under the Lend-Lease
                              program numbered at least 30,000. As part of war reparations, Harley-Davidson acquired the
                              design of a small German motorcycle, the DKW RT 125, which they adapted, manufactured, and
                              sold from 1948 to 1966. Various models were made, including the Hummer from 1955 to 1959.

                              MV Agusta is a motorcycle manufacturer founded by Count Domenico Agusta on 19 January 1945
                              as one of the branches of the Agusta aircraft company near Milan in Cascina Costa, Italy.
                              Count Domenico Agusta had a passion for mechanical workings and for motorcycle racing.
                              Much like Enzo Ferrari, the Agusta family produced and sold motorcycles almost exclusively
                              to fund their racing efforts. So soon after the start of production of its first model MV
                              98, the company launched its own factory racing program. By that time, the capacity of 98
                              cc was no longer relevant in racing world, which had become more organized and moved on to
                              the classic 125, 250 and 500 cc categories. n July 1954, MV began offering a very
                              limited-availability racing model 175 CSS (Super Sport). The engine was further turned
                              from the CS model, including higher compression ratio and a larger carburetor, to produce
                              15 hp at 8,800 rpm. Cycle parts were the same as the CS model, except it was fitted with
                              Earles forks. MV Agusta 600 debuted at the Milan Trade Fair in 1965 was deliberately
                              distinguished by the massive parts of the 592-cc engine, final shaft drive and weighed 221
                              kg. It became the world's first production motorcycle with a transverse 4-cylinder engine.
                              It was followed by models with engines with a displacement of 743, 790, 837 and 862 cm³,
                              including the legendary 750 Sport and 750 Sport America. The most advanced model, the 1978
                              Grand Prix 1100, developed 119 hp, weighed only 202 kg and accelerated from 0–100 km/h in
                              3.9 sec.

                           The tuning industry has developed rapidly over the past few decades. Tuning has long since
                           become socially acceptable and has arrived in the middle of society. And due to the
                           innumerable
                           possibilities, it is not surprising that more and more specializations in individual areas of
                           tuning are also taking place on motorcycles and scooters.
